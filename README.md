### Required features:
1. There are 6 waypoints, A-F
1. Key-H hides or shows waypoints
1. When a waypoint collides with an egg, it loses 25% of its health (and 25% of its opacity). The 4th collision destroys the waypoint. The waypoint respawns +/- 15 units of its original position with full health.
1. Enemy planes can be in sequential mode or random mode. In sequential mode, they visit the waypoints alphabetically. In random mode, they visit them randomly.
1. Key-J switches between sequential and random mode
1. When a waypoint is moved, the enemy should move towards its new position
1. Application status is displayed: Hero Mode, Number of eggs, Enemy count, Enemies Destroyed, Sequential/Random Mode, Waypoints Shown/Not, Cooldown for the Egg
